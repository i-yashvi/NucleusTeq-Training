What is Apache Spark? 
Apache Spark is a fast, open-source, distributed computing system designed for big data 
processing. It provides an easy-to-use interface for programming entire clusters with implicit 
data parallelism and fault tolerance. 
Key Features 
● In-memory computation for faster processing 
● Support for batch and streaming data 
● APIs for Java, Scala, Python, and R 
● Rich libraries including Spark SQL, MLlib (Machine Learning), GraphX (Graph 
processing), and Spark Streaming 
Why Use Apache Spark? 
● Speed: In-memory processing is much faster than Hadoop MapReduce 
● Ease of use: High-level APIs and SQL support 
● Flexibility: Can run on Hadoop, Kubernetes, standalone, or cloud 
● Ecosystem: Integrates well with many data sources and tools 
Java Support in Spark 
Spark provides native support for Java through its Java APIs, which allow you to build scalable 
big data applications leveraging the Spark Core, DataFrame, and Spark SQL functionalities.
